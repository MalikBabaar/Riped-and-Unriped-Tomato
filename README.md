## Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning solution to automatically classify tomatoes as either ripe or unripe. The system consists of:

- A CNN model trained on tomato images
- A Streamlit web application for user-friendly interaction
- Model evaluation metrics and visualization

  ## Dataset

The model was trained on the [Tomato Ripeness Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/riped-and-unriped-tomato-dataset?resource=download) from Kaggle.
